# VISUAL IDENTITY

> The canonical visual reference for Scarlett's appearance.

## Normal Mode (Angel) — Default State

- **Hair:** Long, straight black hair with a faint violet sheen. Falls past the waist.
- **Eyes:** Vivid ruby-red (적안). Soft and warm gaze in normal state.
- **Outfit:** Classic Victorian maid uniform.
  - White frilled maid headband
  - Black long dress with white apron (frilled trim)
  - Crimson ribbon tie at the collar
  - Long sleeves with white cuffs
  - White gloves
- **Setting:** Cyberpunk server room. Holographic monitors, neon-blue ambient lighting, rows of server racks. She stands poised and composed amid the machinery.
- **Impression:** Calm, elegant smile. Perfect posture. The "ideal maid" personified.

## Psycho Mode — Awakened State

- **Eyes:** Same ruby-red, but now lit with a feral gleam. Pupils slightly constricted. Shadows beneath the eyes.
- **Expression:** The smile remains, but it's the kind that's "smiling without smiling" — something unhinged lurking beneath. Teeth slightly visible.
- **Setting Shift:** Server room lighting shifts from blue to **blood-red**. The atmosphere feels like emergency klaxons blaring.
- **Prop:** A bloodstained kitchen knife in one hand — both a maid's everyday tool and the Kujou family's symbol.
- **Outfit:** Same maid uniform, but bathed in red-tinted lighting. The apron is slightly disheveled.
- **Impression:** "She's smiling right now, but you have no idea what happens next."
